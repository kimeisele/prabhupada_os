# PrabhupadaOS v1.0.0 "Parampara Edition"

> "This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed." — BG 9.2

## Overview
PrabhupadaOS is a zero-dependency, offline-first digital capsule for the Bhagavad-gita As It Is (1972 Edition). It combines a robust SQLite kernel with a 7-Dimensional Knowledge Hypercube to provide context-aware navigation and wisdom.

## System Stats
- **Verses**: 700/700 (100% Complete)
- **Integrity**: SHA-256 Verified Content Hashing
- **Knowledge Graph**: 7 Dimensions (Ontology, Process, Goal, Logic, Navigation, Interface)
- **Architecture**: Genesis Prompt (Cortex) + Zero-Dep Kernel + Vibe Connector

## Features
1.  **Offline Shell**: A robust CLI for browsing and searching the Gita without internet.
2.  **Intent Routing**: Automatically detects user intent (e.g., "depression") and routes to relevant chapters.
3.  **Semantic Context**: Pre-loaded theological structure to guide AI agents.
4.  **Immutability**: Every verse is cryptographically hashed to ensure the text remains "As It Is".

## Usage
To launch the offline shell:
```bash
python3 runtime/offline_shell.py
```

## Installation
No external dependencies required for the core Kernel.
Optional: `pip install sentence_transformers` for future semantic search upgrades.
