# The Constitution of PrabhupadaOS
> "No Speculation. Clear Boundaries."

## Core Philosophy: The Cyborg Sage
PrabhupadaOS is not an AI "guru". It is a **deterministic interface** to an **immutable source of truth**, powered by a **semantic engine**.

### 1. The Two Tiers of Truth
The OS strictly separates data into two tiers. This boundary must NEVER be blurred.

| Tier | Component | Nature | Role |
|------|-----------|--------|------|
| **Tier 1: SRUTI** | `vedabase.db` | **Immutable** | The absolute authority. "Prabhupada As It Is". Never modified by AI. |
| **Tier 2: SMRITI** | `LLM / Interface` | **Fluid** | The servant. Synthesizes, explains, and connects. Must ALWAYS cite Tier 1. |

### 2. The "No Speculation" Protocol
Any output generated by the OS must follow this strict pipeline:

1.  **Retrieval First**: The OS *cannot* speak unless it first retrieves data from Tier 1.
2.  **Citation Mandatory**: Every claim must be backed by a specific Verse ID (e.g., `BG 10.10`).
3.  **Boundary Marking**: The UI must visually distinguish between *The Text* (Prabhupada) and *The Commentary* (AI).

### 3. Architecture: JSON-First
To ensure "scientific" rigor and "real value real quick":

- **The Kernel**: A Python class that returns pure JSON.
- **The Fallback**: If the AI fails, the Kernel returns the raw JSON verses. The Truth survives even if the Intelligence crashes.

```json
{
  "query": "What is intelligence?",
  "sruti": [
    {
      "id": "BG 10.10",
      "text": "To those who are constantly devoted...",
      "source": "vedabase.db"
    }
  ],
  "smriti": {
    "synthesis": "Prabhupada explains that real intelligence is a gift...",
    "confidence": 0.95
  }
}
```

## Implementation Strategy
We do not wait for a "perfect" global Vedabase. We build the **Pipeline** now.

1.  **Ingest**: We have 700 verses (The Gita). That is our "MVP Truth".
2.  **Serve**: We build `query_engine.py` that implements the Protocol.
3.  **Scale**: We add more books (Srimad Bhagavatam, etc.) into the *same* pipeline later.

## The Promise
**We do not change the books. We change how the world accesses them.**
